		<h2><center> My name is Esther Hambolu</center></h2>
<p>
			I am a sophmore studying Computational Media at The Georgia Institute of Technology. I decided I wanted to major in Computational Media because of my love of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I want to learn about film production, interactive narration, artificial intelligence and many more tools that I know will be useful in revolutionizing film.

				<h2><center> I'm obsessed with Television Shows.</center></h2>
		<P>Television has been my favorite forms of entertainment for as long as I can remember. It is my favorite way to escape from whatever routine I'm in and observe a different reality. Just as there's a kind of book for everyone in TV there are endless shows for every kind of person. Television is one of my favorite expereinces to share with people.
